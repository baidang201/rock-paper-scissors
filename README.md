# Play 'Rock Paper Scissors'

I used Vue.js to create a graphical **Rock Paper Scissors** game. Version 1.0 is a best of 5 game. 

When the user takes a turn, the results are shown with images of either a rock, paper, or scissors. After a winner is determined (winner of 3 games), the user is presented with the option to play again.
